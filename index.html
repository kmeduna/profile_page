      Hello, I'm Teri. I enjoy trying new foods, binge watching tv shows, sleep, and listening to music. I've played the viola for about 8 years now. I got my 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I'll be a senior in September. I'll be taking AP computer science. I code in Java and use Eclipse. I love spending time with my family. I have 2 dogs. I also ride a longbaord and a dirtbike. I've taken Japanese for 3 years and in September it will be my 4th year.
